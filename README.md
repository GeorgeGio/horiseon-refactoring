# Refactoring Horiseon webpage 


## Description

In this project, our objective is to improve the ***accessibility*** of our given page.

In order to do this we can use refactoring which refers to improving the codebase of the webpage without altering how the page looks or funtions. 

Industries use and consider the importance of such process as it ensures that people with disabilities can access the given site, through the use of tech applications such as - screen readers.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.
